# Hello there

Chrome extension for highlighting words of a particular length in a given webpage.

To use the extension:

- Download
- Go to Chrome extensions:
  - Menu -> More Tools -> Extensions
- Click 'Load Unpacked' and choose the 'Chrome Extension' folder
- The extension should be ready to use

Some functionality is only exists if rather than using the extension you run the function in your console, in the future this functionality will be added into the extension UI, which will be improved in general.

# Translators Aid

Chrome extension for highlighting words of a particular length in a given webpage.

To use the extension:

- Download
- Go to Chrome extensions:
  - Menu -> More Tools -> Extensions
- Check 'Developer mode' toggle if it isn't already
  - (if it's not there at all google this)
- Click 'Load Unpacked' and choose the 'Chrome Extension' folder
- The extension should be ready to use

Some functionality only exists if, rather than using the extension, you run the function in your console (see renderHighlights.js). In the future this functionality will be added into the extension UI, in fact the main next steps would be to improve the UI.
